#Problem 6 - Union and Intersection
The "union" function has while loops, each of which corresponds to a linked list. So, its performance is order N.
 The intersection function has a loop within a loop that determines whether the values in the two lists are the same. So O (N * * 2)
Time complexity :O(n**2)
Space complexity :O(n) 
The 'set' function creates a unique list of caches. With the linked list and the cache set, there's a big O(n) space.
